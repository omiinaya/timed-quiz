This is a timed quiz made using a dynamic HTML webpage, semantic tags, JavaScript, CSS for styling, Bootstrap and jQuery.

-The quiz starts when the user presses the quiz start button.

-Two timers start as soon as the quiz is initialized. 

-One of them counts your time passed and the other one your time left to answer the question.

-On correct answer, the user is given 5 extra seconds to answer his question.

-On incorrect answer, the user has 5 seconds taken away from his time left to answer the question.

-If the time runs out, the quiz is stopped and the current score is final.

-On try again, all variables and divs are reset back to normal allowing the user to start the quiz again.
